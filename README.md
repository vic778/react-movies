# React Movies

> This is a personal project to improve my skills in React that  I have used the backend link provided by (TMDB):

    - a Home page with the components
    - a UserLilst page which contains the list of movies the user liked and stored in the LocalStorage
    - Header component which contains the Navbar and the links
    - Form component which contains a function to retrieve the Data from the database and which contains a logic to    display the average from ascending to descending
    - Card component which contains a function to display the movies via the Props of the react and which contains a Switch function to display the Genre of each movie and the date of publication.
